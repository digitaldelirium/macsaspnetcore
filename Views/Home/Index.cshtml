                    <h1>BLACK LIVES MATTER</h1>
                    <p>Given the current climate and the fact that police brutality has occurred for far too long, Mac's Camping Area would like to exclaim that BLACK LIVES MATTER!</p>
                    <p>Full Disclosure:</p>
                    <p>Carrie McDonald Cornett, the proprietor of Mac's Camping Area is married to a mixed-race African-American husband who is also in charge of the website.  
                        That is not particularly relevant until you factor in that our daughter is a mixed-race almost quarter African American female. 
                        This will not happen to our daughter if we have anything to say about it! We see you Breoona Taylor, Charleena Lyles, Philando Castile, George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, et. al.
                        This extends beyond us all,  All lives matter, and thus BLACK LIVES MATTER! Their/my house is on fire, this needs attention now and if you don't like it, 
                        we don't need, nor want your business! Find another whites-only campground!  We stand for UNITY!</p>
                        <br/>
                    <h1>Camp is now OPEN!!!!!</h1>
                    <h2>We are so extremely excited to celebrate our 50th year!!!</h2>
                    <h3>Please bear with us as we quickly adjust to this delightfully unexpected opening!</h3>
